## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a fun one! I learned a lot about margin-collapse and the reason why it happens, and as well as how grids work. Though centering a div is still quite confusing, I managed to do it, of course with the help of our jolly old pal, W3Schools.

### Continued development

I guess I should be working more on my HTML5 semantics and my Grid game. Grid is pretty powerful when developing a responsive website and I would love to learn more about its amazing features.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This site helped me understand the concepts of Grid and its properties.
